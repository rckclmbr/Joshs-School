\par Case Study 4.3 \endash  Is Point Q Inside Convex Polygon P?
\par 
\par }{\b\f29\ul\insrsid4984069 Problem Statement}{\f29\insrsid4984069 
\par 
\par The purpose of this case study is to create a graphic program that allows the user to draw a convex polygon, and then be able to click a point anywhere on the world window.  The point where the user clicks the mouse will either be inside or outside of the
 
polygon.  The program will then display text that will inform the user whether that point is inside or outside.  The program will contain certain logic that will be able to determine where the point lies in respect to the polygon.  The points of the polyg
o
n will be displayed in red, and the point being tested will be displayed in green.  As additional functionality, the program will also allow the user to move points on the polygon.  In designing and implementing this program, it becomes a demonstration of
 using vectors with points.  
\par 
\par }{\b\f29\ul\insrsid4984069 Proposed Solution}{\f29\insrsid4984069 
\par 
\par The first thing that we knew that needed to be done was to create some mouse event functions.  These functions would allow the user to create the polygon on the screen.  For this to happen, we created two functions.  The first function called}{
\f2\fs20\cf1\insrsid4984069  }{\f2\cf1\insrsid4984069 myMouseState}{\f29\cf1\insrsid4984069  checks which button on the mouse is being clicked.    
\par 
\par When the program is first initialized, a global boolean variable named }{\f2\cf1\insrsid4984069 initializeComplete}{\f29\cf1\insrsid4984069  is false.  At this point when the left button is clicked, it 
will create a point on the screen.  The maximum number of points that can be created is 100.  When the user has created the points desired, then they can click the right mouse button to connect all of the points.  Only one click is needed.  This will also
 set the variable }{\f2\cf1\insrsid4984069 initializeComplete}{\f29\cf1\insrsid4984069   to be true.  The next time the same function is called it will look at a different scenario because it will test the value of }{\f2\cf1\insrsid4984069 
initializeComplete}{\f29\cf1\insrsid4984069 .  
\par 
\par At this point, when the left button is clicked, it will create the poi
nt to be tested.  The right button will allow the user to move points on the polygon.  When this occurs a different mouse event function is called that will test for the movement and move the point to where the user specifies.  
\par 
\par In order to solve the prob
lem of testing if a point is actually inside the polygon or not, we decided to use the method described in the book.  This method uses the equation: Q lies in P if (Q - Pi) * ni < 0 for i = 0, 1, ...., N - 1.  Q equals the point being tested, Pi equals a 
p
oint on the polygon, and ni = a bounding line that passes through points P1 and P2 on the polygon.  If a point Q that lies inside the polygon, the angle with n1 is greater than 90 degrees.  If a point Q lies outside the polygon, then the angle will be les
s than 90 degrees.
\par 
\par Once the polygon has been drawn, and the user clicks a point on the screen; the program will call a function called }{\f2\cf1\insrsid4984069 insideOutside}{\f29\cf1\insrsid4984069 
 to test whether the point is inside or outside.  The function uses the above mentioned method to make the c
alculation. The function uses the point being tested along with the closest points on the polygon to find vectors.  The vectors are then used to calculate the angle by the dot product rule.  The function then tests the size of the angle.  This information
 gets passed to the }{\f2\cf1\insrsid4984069 display}{\f29\cf1\insrsid4984069  function
\par 
\par The }{\f2\cf1\insrsid4984069 display}{\f29\cf1\insrsid4984069  function and the mouse event functions are called from the main method.  The }{\f2\cf1\insrsid4984069 myMouseState}{\f29\cf1\insrsid4984069  function calls the }{\f2\cf1\insrsid4984069 
insideOutside}{\f29\cf1\insrsid4984069  function to test the points.  The display function also looks at some of the variabl
es in order to determine which text message should display.  When the point being tested is inside the polygon, a text message will display stating the point lies inside.  The same will occur if the point is outside and will display the appropriate messag
e.

\par 
\par This project was a good continuation of the last project that we worked on.  In the last project we were presented with the challenge of drawing a line through a rectangle.  This project took that idea to the next level.  Instead of a rectangle
, now we had to work with polygons.  Instead a line, we had to use points and determine if it is inside the shape.  The user also has to be able to draw the polygon and specify where the point being tested will go.  This was definitely a good way to apply
 what we learned about vectors to the same idea.
\par 
\par The main challenge that we faced as a group was deciding how to sp
lit up the code writing portion.  We knew that we wanted at least two people to write the code.  Once we had sorted through the details, everything seemed to fall into place.  The group worked together really well, and we were able to pull everything toge
ther in the end.  The code looks really good, and works as expected.
